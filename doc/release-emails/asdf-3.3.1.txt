Today we release ASDF 3.3.1, the first bugfix release for the 3.3.0 release series.  Of primary interest in this release are

1. a fix for an incompatibility in the UIOP stamp-comparison functions.  The handling of infinity as a bound in these functions changed between 3.2 and 3.3, potentially causing problems in backward compatibility.  In order to maintain compatibility, the old behavior was restored to the stamp-comparison functions, and new functions -- TIMEstamp comparison functions -- were added to carry the new behaviors.

2. a fix for upgrade from version 3.2.1

3. fixes for bugs that can occur when the default readtable is manipulated inside a dependency loaded by DEFSYSTEM-DEPENDS-ON.

We urge implementations that are currently bundling previous versions of ASDF -- and especially those bundling 3.3.0 -- to upgrade to 3.3.1 at their earliest convenience.

Here is the changelog entry for 3.3.1:
