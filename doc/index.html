        <h3>ASDF 3</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3, pre-released as 2.28 on February 1st 2013,
          is the current successor to Daniel Barlow's ASDF.
          It was rewritten for improved portability, robustness, usability,
          extensibility, configurability, internal consistency,
          and the ability to create standalone executables.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is"></a>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 contains two parts: ASDF/DEFSYSTEM and ASDF/DRIVER.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF/DEFSYSTEM,
          is a tool to describe how Lisp source code is organized in systems,
          and how to build a system in term of actions that depend on previous actions.
        </p>
        <p>It is roughly what Common Lisp hackers use to build software
          where C hackers might use GNU Make.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF stands for <em>A</em>nother <em>S</em>ystem <em>D</em>efinition <em>F</em>acility,
          in the continuity of the Lisp DEFSYSTEM of yore.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF/DRIVER is a Common Lisp portability library and runtime support system
          that helps you write Common Lisp software in a portable way.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to many general-purpose Lisp utilities,
          it notably provides portable abstractions to
          gloss over implementation quirks, support hot-upgrade of code,
          manipulate pathnames, create programs, use command-line arguments,
          access the environment, use the filesystem,
          call other programs and parse their output,
          compile Lisp code, muffle conditions, or configure Lisp software.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is_not"></a>
        <h3>What it is not</h3>
        <p>ASDF will <em>not</em> download missing software components for you.
          For that, you want <a href="http://quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp</a>,
          that builds upon ASDF, and is great for pulling and installing
          tarballs of packages you may depend upon;
          we also recommend <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/">clbuild</a>,
          that now builds upon Quicklisp, as a great tool for pulling from version control
          packages you need to modify or want to contribute to.
          We recommend you should <em>not</em> use ASDF-Install anymore,
          as it is an older similar piece of software that is both unmaintained and obsolete.
        </p><p>
          If you're unsatisfied with ASDF, other actively maintained build systems for Common-Lisp
          that may or may not satisfy you include:
          Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau's
          <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/xcvb/">XCVB</a>
          (trying to build object and image files deterministically and in parallel),
          or its polar opposite,
          Drew McDermott's
          <a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/">YTools</a>
          (trying to maintain coherence of the current Lisp image at a fine grain),
          the newcomer
          <a href="http://lisp.ystok.ru/asdlite/">ASDlite</a>
          (a somewhat improved incompatible variant of ASDF 1, less featureful than ASDF 3),
          or Alastair Bridgewater's interesting quick-build (unreleased, similar to faslpath below).
          Older systems that are not maintained anymore include
          Mark Kantrowitz's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem">mk-defsystem</a>
          (free software successor of the old proprietary DEFSYSTEM's and predecessor of ASDF, obsolete),
          Sean Ross's <a href="http://sean-ross.blogspot.com/search/label/mudballs">mudballs</a>
          (an attempt at making things cleaner than in ASDF, aborted),
          Peter Etter's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath">faslpath</a>
          (a much simpler system establishing a mapping between packages and files)
          Alexander Kahl's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/evol">evol</a>
          (a reimplementation of the GNU autotools stack in Lisp, abandoned),
          and probably more.
          However, none of these systems seems to ever have had the traction of ASDF.
        </p>
        <a id="implementations"></a>
        <h3>Supported Implementations</h3>
        <p>ASDF 3 now supports all CL implementations
          that seem to have any current user base, and then some.
        </p><p>
          Most implementations provide ASDF 2 as a module,
          and you can simply <tt>(require "asdf")</tt>.
          (All of them but CLISP also accept
          <tt>:asdf</tt>, <tt>"ASDF"</tt> or <tt>'asdf</tt> as an argument.)
        </p><p>
          They will hopefully soon all provide ASDF 3,
          but in the meantime, you can download ASDF 3,
          and use <tt>(asdf:load-system :asdf)</tt>
          from a properly configured ASDF 2 to upgrade to the latest,
          which you should before you use ASDF for anything else.
        </p><p>
          A few implementations don't provide ASDF yet,
          but have announced they will in their next release.
          As for remaining implementations,
          they are obsolete and/or mostly unmaintained;
          still ASDF 3 supports them if you load it manually,
          though there might never be a next release
          to provide it through <tt>require</tt>.
        </p>

          to see as many examples.</p>

        <a id="documentation"></a>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>You can read our manual:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="asdf.html">as one HTML file</a></li>
          <li><a href="asdf/">split into one HTML file per section</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>Regarding the internal design of ASDF in general,
          and the work we did on ASDF 2,
          see the last draft version of our paper for
          <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org/2010/index">ILC 2010</a>,

        <p>Finally, while the manual covers all the basics,
          some advanced or new features remain underdocumented.
          Please contact our mailing-list (see below)
          for any issue that isn't well-documented enough.
        </p>
        <p>Until we write more documentation on the further innovations of ASDF 3,
          the documentation strings, the source code, the changelog and the git log
          are unfortunately your best chances for discovering the available functionality.

        <a id="extensions"></a>
        <h3>Extensions</h3>
        <p>Known extensions to ASDF include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf-contrib.git"
		 >asdf-contrib</a>,
	    a collection of most of the below.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf-encodings.git"
		 >asdf-encodings</a>,
	    to compile Lisp source files with character encodings other than UTF-8.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/asdf/asdf-finalizers.git"
		 >asdf-finalizers</a>,
	    to allow macros to include code to be evaluated
	    at the end of a file being compiled.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/gitweb?p=projects/xcvb/asdf-dependency-grovel.git"
		 >asdf-dependency-grovel</a>,
	    to compute the actual dependencies in a big ASDF system.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/qitab/"
		 >poiu</a>,
	    to compile a system in parallel.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf-system-connections/"
		 >asdf-system-connections</a>,
	    lets you specify systems that are automatically loaded when
            two other systems are loaded, to connect them.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~didier/software/lisp/misc.php#asdf-flv"
		 >asdf-flv</a>,
	    to bind file-local variables around the compilation of some files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Former extensions, now superseded, include:</p>
        <ul>
	  <li>ASDF-BINARY-LOCATIONS allowed one to redirect where ASDF creates its output files,
            so they don't clash between implementations and don't pollute source directories.
            It is superseded by ASDF/DEFSYSTEM's builtin ASDF-OUTPUT-TRANSLATIONS mechanism;
            a limited compatibility mode is available to easily convert
            your former ABL configuration into an AOT configuration.
            COMMON-LISP-CONTROLLER and CL-LAUNCH used to provide similar mechanisms,
            and have also been superseded by ASDF-OUTPUT-TRANSLATIONS.
          </li>
	  <li>ASDF-BUNDLE, née ASDF-ECL,
            allowed you to create a single-file bundle out of a system,
            for easier delivery.
            It is now a builtin part of ASDF/DEFSYSTEM,
            and allows to deliver a single FASL for a system,
            or (on supported implementations), a standalone executable program.
          </li>
	  <li>ASDF-UTILS was a collection of utilities that originated with ASDF.
            It is now superseded by ASDF/DRIVER, which is part of ASDF,
            and exports its functionality in its own package ASDF/DRIVER.
          </li>
	  <li>ASDF-CONDITION-CONTROL, initially part of XCVB's XCVB-DRIVER,
            allowed you to muffle uninteresting conditions during compilation.
            Is now superseded by equivalent functionality in ASDF/DRIVER.
          </li>
	</ul>

        <h3>What is happening</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>In February 2013</dt>
          <dd>
            ASDF 3 now includes both the traditional ASDF/DEFSYSTEM
            and a formalized portability library ASDF/DRIVER.
            ASDF/DEFSYSTEM is a backward-compatible reimplementation of ASDF
            with correct timestamp propagation based on a consistent dependency model,
            and featuring support for bundle output, deferred warnings, and more.
            ASDF/DRIVER provides many abstractions to write portable Common Lisp programs.
          </dd>
          <dt>In April 2012</dt>
          <dd>
            ASDF 2.21 now controls the character encoding used by Lisp source files.
            You can specify different encodings in your defsystem,
            e.g. <kbd>:encoding :latin1</kbd>,
            if you <kbd>:defsystem-depends-on (:asdf-encodings)</kbd>.
            While the default will remain to load and compile file
            with the <kbd>:default</kbd> external-format,
            we encourage all library authors to adopt
            the <i>de facto</i> standard, UTF-8,
            for all their source files (.lisp and .asd).
            Our intent is to bless and enforce this standard encoding
            on all these files by default in a not-to-faraway future.
