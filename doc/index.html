        <h3>ASDF 2</h3>
        <p>ASDF 2, initially released on May 31st 2010,
          is the current successor to Daniel Barlow's ASDF,
          made more portable and more robust, with a somewhat improved API.
          It has since been widely adopted by the CL community,
          and is actively maintained.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is"></a>
        <h3>What it is</h3>
        <p>ASDF is a tool for describing how source files are organized:
          what depends on which and when.
        </p>
        <p>It is roughly what Common Lisp hackers use to build software
          where C hackers would use say GNU Make.
        </p>
        <p>ASDF stands for <em>A</em>nother <em>S</em>ystem <em>D</em>efinition <em>F</em>acility,
          in the continuity of the Lisp DEFSYSTEM of yore.
        </p>
        <a id="what_it_is_not"></a>
        <h3>What it is not</h3>
        <p>ASDF will <em>not</em> download missing software components for you.
          For that, you want <a href="http://quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp</a>,
          that builds upon ASDF, and is great for pulling and installing
          tarballs of packages you may depend upon;
          we also recommend <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/">clbuild</a>,
          that now builds upon Quicklisp, as a great tool for pulling from version control
          packages you need to modify or want to contribute to.
          We recommend you should <em>not</em> use ASDF-Install anymore,
          as it is an older similar piece of software that is both unmaintained and obsolete.
        </p><p>
          If you're unsatisfied with ASDF, other actively maintained build systems for Common-Lisp
          that may or may not satisfy you include:
          Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau's
          <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/xcvb/">XCVB</a>
          (trying to build object and image files deterministically and in parallel),
          or its polar opposite,
          Drew McDermott's
          <a href="http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/">YTools</a>
          (trying to maintain coherence of the current Lisp image at a fine grain),
          or the newcomer
          <a href="http://lisp.ystok.ru/asdlite/">ASDlite</a>
          (a somewhat improved incompatible variant of ASDF 1).
          Older systems that are not maintained anymore include
          Mark Kantrowitz's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/mk-defsystem">mk-defsystem</a>
          (free software successor of the old proprietary DEFSYSTEM's and predecessor of ASDF),
          Sean Ross's <a href="http://sean-ross.blogspot.com/search/label/mudballs">mudballs</a>
          (aborted attempt at making things cleaner than in ASDF),
          Peter Etter's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/faslpath">faslpath</a>
          (a much simpler system establishing a mapping between packages and files),
          Alexander Kahl's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/evol">evol</a>
          (a reimplementation of the GNU autotools stack in Lisp),
          and probably more.
          However, none of these systems seems to ever have had the traction of ASDF.
        </p>
        <a id="implementations"></a>
        <h3>Supported Implementations</h3>
        <p>ASDF 2 now supports all CL implementations
          that seem to have any current user base.
        </p><p>
          Most implementations provide ASDF 2 as a module,
          and you can simply <tt>(require "asdf")</tt>.
          (All of them but CLISP also accept
          <tt>:asdf</tt>, <tt>"ASDF"</tt> or <tt>'asdf</tt> as an argument.)
        </p><p>
          A few implementations don't provide ASDF yet,
          but have announced they will in their next release.
          As for remaining implementations,
          they are obsolete and/or mostly unmaintained;
          still ASDF 2 supports them if you load it manually,
          though there might never be a next release
          to provide it through <tt>require</tt>.
        </p>

          If there is an old or new implementation that we are missing,
          it shouldn't be hard to adapt ASDF to support it.

        <p>Finally, while the manual covers all the basics,
          some advanced or new features remain underdocumented.

        <h3>What is happening</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>In April 2012</dt>
          <dd>
            ASDF 2.21 now controls the character encoding used by Lisp source files.
            You can specify different encodings in your defsystem,
            e.g. <kbd>:encoding :latin1</kbd>,
            if you <kbd>:defsystem-depends-on (:asdf-encodings)</kbd>.
            While the default will remain to load and compile file
            with the <kbd>:default</kbd> external-format,
            we encourage all library authors to adopt
            the <i>de facto</i> standard, UTF-8,
            for all their source files (.lisp and .asd).
            Our intent is to bless and enforce this standard encoding
            on all these files by default in a not-to-faraway future.
          </dd>
          <dt>Since December 2009</dt>
          <dd>Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; Rideau is de facto maintainer,
            with notable contributions from Robert P. Goldman, but also
            Juanjo Garcia-Ripoll and James Anderson.
            ASDF 2 released
            with many clean-ups, better configurability, some new features,
            and updated documentation.

            Robert P. Goldman, Nikodemus Siivola, Christophe Rhodes, Daniel Herring.
            Many small features and bug fixes,
            making the project more maintainable,
            moving to using git and common-lisp.net.
            Last version: 1.369.
