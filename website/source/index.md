### What it is

ASDF is

* *A*nother *S*ystem *D*efinition *F*acility.

* A way to describe how your source files are organized: what
  depends on which and when.

* A de-facto standard in need of some tender loving care.

For details, you can read the [tutorial][],
browse the [manual][], or just look further down
this page to grab the source code.

### Mailing Lists

  * [asdf-devel][]: A list for questions, patches,
    bug reports, and so on; It's for everything.

<a href="downloads"></a>

### Where is it

Though they may lag behind the version here, ASDF comes
bundled with most Lisps. To get the greatest and latest, you
can:

* download just the source for [asdf.lisp][],
* download the [tarball][] to get all bells and whistles,
* pull the latest from our git repository

        git clone http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.git

{remark * use [ASDF-install][] to update yourself }

### Contributing

We're still working out the details. For now, send email to
gwking@metabang.com or the project [mailing-list][asdf-devel]
with questions or patches.
