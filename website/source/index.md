### What it is

ASDF is

* *A*nother *S*ystem *D*efinition *F*acility.

* A way to describe how your source files are organized: what depends on which and when.

* A defacto-standard in need of some tender loving care.

For details, you can read the [tutorial][], browse the
[manual][], or just look further down this page to grab the
source code.

### Mailing Lists

  * [asdf-devel][]: A list for questions, patches,
    bug reports, and so on; It's for everything.

### Where is it

Thought they may lag behind the version here, ASDF comes
bundled with most Lisps. To get the greatest and latest, you
can:

* download [asdf.lisp][],
* download the [tarball][] to get all bells and whistles,
* pull the latest from our git repository

        git FOO http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf

* use [ASDF-install][] to update yourself

### What is happening

### Contributing



2.  Please explain to us the working pattern for ASDF + git.  E.g., I
occasionally submit a small patch or two to Carsten Dominik's org-mode,
and I am happy that he has clearly explained the git-usage pattern.  For
that project, you pull from Carsten, branch, develop new code, create a
patch, submit to Carsten and, if all goes well, it goes into Carsten's
master repo.  Is this a workable pattern for ASDF?  If not, do you have
something different in mind?  git is such a flexible tool that (at least
to me) saying we're going to move to git doesn't tell me how we're going
to work as a community.
