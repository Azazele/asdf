ASDF: another system definition facility
========================================

If you cloned our git repository, bootstrap a copy of build/asdf.lisp with:
    make

To run all the tests on your favorite Lisp implementation $L,
choose your most elaborate installed system $S, and try:
    make t u l=$L s=$S


To use ASDF, read our manual:
    http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html
The first few sections, Loading ASDF, Configuring ASDF and Using ASDF,
will get you started as a simple user.
If you want to define your own systems, further read the section
Defining systems with defsystem.


ASDF 3 now includes an extensive runtime support library:
UIOP, the Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability.
Its documentation unhappily lies mainly in the source code and docstrings.


More information and additional links can be found on ASDF's home page at:
    http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/


Debugging tip:
To load ASDF in such a way that M-. will work, install the source code, and run
(asdf:load-system :uiop) ;; for uiop
(dolist (c (asdf::required-components :asdf/defsystem
             :keep-component 'asdf:cl-source-file))
  (load (asdf:component-pathname c))) ;; for asdf/defsystem
