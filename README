ASDF: Another System Definition Facility
========================================

Quick Summary
-------------

  1- Build it with::

	make


  2- Make sure you put it under a path registered by the source-registry,
    if that isn't the case yet (see the manual). One place would be::

	~/.local/share/common-lisp/source/asdf/


What is ASDF?
-------------

ASDF is the de facto standard build facility for Common Lisp.

If you come from the C/C++ world, the function ASDF covers a bit of what
each of Make, autoconf, Make, dlopen and libc do for C programs:
it orchestrates the compilation and dependency management,
handles some of the portability issues, dynamically finds and loads code,
and offers some portable system access.
Except everything is different in Common Lisp, and ultimately much simpler,
though it requires acquiring some basic concepts;
notably, ASDF tries to make it all happen in the current Lisp image.

To use ASDF, read our manual::

    http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html

The first few sections, Loading ASDF, Configuring ASDF and Using ASDF,
will get you started as a simple user.
If you want to define your own systems, further read the section
Defining systems with defsystem.

ASDF 3 now includes an extensive runtime support library:
UIOP, the Utilities for Implementation- and OS- Portability.
Its documentation unhappily lies mainly in the source code and docstrings.
See uiop/README for an introduction.

More information and additional links can be found on ASDF's home page at::

    http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/


Building and testing it
-----------------------

If you cloned our git repository, bootstrap a copy of build/asdf.lisp with::

    make

To run all the tests on your favorite Lisp implementation $L,
choose your most elaborate installed system $S, and try::

    make t u l=$L s=$S


Debugging tip
-------------

To load ASDF in such a way that M-. will work, install the source code, and run::

  (asdf:load-system :uiop) ;; for uiop
  (map () 'load ;; for asdf/defsystem
   (mapcar 'asdf:component-pathname
    (asdf::required-components :asdf/defsystem :keep-component 'asdf:cl-source-file)))
