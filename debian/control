Description: Another System Definition Facility
 asdf provides a "make" type functions for Common Lisp packages. It
 provides compilation and loading features for complex Lisp systems
 with multiple modules and files. It is similar in concept to, but
 with features different from, "defsystem" which is included in the
 common-lisp-controller package. Unlike defsystem3 in CLC, asdf is
 object-oriented and extensible.
