cl-asdf (2:2.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * ASDF-BUNDLE was merged into ASDF.
    This notably means fewer headaches for users of ECL;
    it also means a new load-fasl-op feature for all users of a modern CL,
    making it easier to deliver software as a single fasl.
    All remnants of its predecessor asdf-ecl were removed.

  * *decades-old* bugs of notable significance were fixed:
    (a) changes in dependencies now trigger a rebuild across systems, and
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/479522
    (b) timestamps are now correctly propagated
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/asdf/+bug/1087609
    In olden days, some have argued for not rebuilding systems that :depend-on
    a modified one as a "feature". It really isn't. On the other hand,
    if they want to explicitly prevent a rebuild, the actual feature :force-not
    is there to help them (released as part of 2.21 in April 2012).
    I will write about those bugs.

  * PREPARE-OP was introduced to fix a conceptual bug in the ASDF object model.
    It corresponds to "loading the dependencies of a component and its parents"
    and is explicitly depends-on'ed before to load or compile the component,
    instead of implicitly depending on it via magic in the TRAVERSE algorithm,
    which magic proved insufficient in cases revealed by the above bugs.
    It propagates upward in the component hierarchy, rather than downward,
    like the TRAVERSE algorithm used to systematically propagate dependencies.

  * TRAVERSE was gutted out and factored into reusable higher-order functions
    and objects, which not only fixes the above conceptual bug, but makes for
    semantics that are simpler to implement, possible to understand,
    easier to extend, and less limited in expressivity.
    TRAVERSE doesn't automatically propagate operations
    downward the component hierarchy anymore;
    propagation is now implemented through methods on COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON.

  * COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON is now more powerful:
    it can express dependencies on arbitrary operation objects
    (i.e. operations of the same class can have different options)
    acting on arbitrary component objects
    (i.e. not necessarily siblings of the current component).
    The ASDF object model can now express arbitrary build graphs, with
    no more special magic for children components vs other dependencies.

  * COMPONENT-DO-FIRST is no more. It used to specify some dependencies
    that were skipped if no re-build was triggered based on local timestamps.
    Instead, COMPONENT-DEPENDS-ON is used for all dependencies,
    and all are consulted to correctly propagate timestamps.
    However actions meant for in-image side-effects are included
    only if needed, and might be visited twice by TRAVERSE,
    first without the needed-in-image-p flag, another time with.

  * FORCE and FORCE-NOT now correctly distinguish T from :ALL in addition to
    a list of system name specifiers, as per the original specification
    (which was never implemented in ASDF 1). Additionally,
    builtin systems (such as SB-BSD-SOCKETS on SBCL) cannot be forced
    (which doesn't work on SBCL).

  * IF-FEATURE is a new attribute of components that accepts an arbitrary
    feature expression such as (:and :sbcl (:or :x86 :x86-64)),
    which when defined is a precondition to the component being enabled;
    when the expression is false, the component is disabled,
    and dependencies to it are removed.
    It replaces the misguided :if-component-dep-fails attribute of modules
    and the accompanying :feature feature, which were dropped.
    They were not very expressive, clunky to use, and relied on baking
    conceptually dubious non-local behavior in the old TRAVERSE algorithm,
    which belied the object model and defeated other features.
    Unhappily, this breaks backwards compatibility for the few who used it,
    namely sb-grovel, nibbles and ironclad.
    A minimal compatibility layer allows ASDF 2.27 or later to load
    the SB-GROVEL of old versions of SBCL, but it won't suffice to load
    an old version of nibbles or ironclad; please upgrade them
    a recent version that was updated to support ASDF 2.27.

  * ASDF2.27 was added to the *features* so you can detect the presence of
    this massively updated ASDF and its new features with #+asdf2.27.
    This is *not* ASDF3, for we painfully maintained backwards compatibility.

  * CONCATENATE-SOURCE-OP is a new operation that builds a single Lisp file
    from all the source files in a system,
    which allows you to develop in a structured way with many compact files,
    yet deliver a large single file. Other related operations allow you
    to load that source file, or compile and load it,
    or do the same while including all other system dependencies.
    ASDF was broken up into lots of small files, to be delivered that way.

  * Packages were introduced as ASDF was broken up into small files.
    Each file now has its own package, importing and exporting functionality,
    following the style made popular by faslpath and quick-build.
    A macro DEFINE-PACKAGE was defined in replacement to DEFPACKAGE
    to manage the same effects while making every effort to
    Do The Right Thing(tm) in case of hot upgrade.

  * ASDF-DRIVER is a separately-usable library for Common Lisp runtime support.
    It is transcluded in asdf.lisp (i.e. when delivering ASDF as a separate
    bootstrap file, the contents of ASDF-DRIVER have been included in it),
    but can also be used as a separate ASDF system on top of an old ASDF
    (within limits: CLISP and XCL still need a recent ASDF).
    The package ASDF/DRIVER (with short nickname :D) re-exports
    all the functions that ASDF needed to run portably.

  * Pathnames are a notable part of ASDF-DRIVER, required to deal
    portably with pathnames despite the many bugs and variations
    from platform to platform. See notably in pathname.lisp,
    MERGE-PATHNAMES*, SUBPATHNAME, PARSE-UNIX-NAMESTRING,
    PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING, ENSURE-PATHNAME, and many many more.

  * Image lifecycle support is included in ASDF-DRIVER (and thus ASDF);
    this standardizes things like access to *COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS*,
    declaring an entry-point to a program, hook functions and/or a prelude
    to run before to start the main entry, and a postlude and/or hook functions
    to run before to dump an image, dumping or creating an image, etc.
    ASDF provides initial implementations of an operation program-op
    to create standalone executables (if available on your implementation).

  * Internals have been refactored, and some sorry features were excised.
    The semantics of OPERATION-DONE-P is simplified and now well-specified.
    FIND-COMPONENT will pass component objects through, and
    a corresponding FIND-OPERATION replaces MAKE-SUB-OPERATION.
    Many internal accessors were renamed, after checking on Quicklisp
    that no one was using them.

  * Portability updates were done for
    ABCL, CLISP, Clozure CL, CMUCL, ECL, LispWorks Personal Edition, MKCL, XCL.
    Working support for GCL 2.6 was restored, with notable limitations
    including lack of support for output-translations or logical-pathnames.

  * Documentation received some small updates.

  * Tests were updated, notably including support for bundles and encodings.
    They were successfully run on ccl clisp sbcl ecl ecl_bytecodes
    cmucl abcl scl allegro lispworks allegromodern xcl.
    Manual tests were run on lispworks-personal-edition genera.
    Untested were cormancl mkcl rmcl.

  * POIU was updated. This extension is still distributed separately from ASDF.
    It is now much simplified and made correct by construction by
    reusing the new TRAVERSE infrastructure of ASDF and now being able to
    assume the ASDF object model is a complete description of dependencies.
    On SBCL it will handle deferred warnings from background compilations.
    Where forking is not possible or not supported,
    it will gracefully fall back to serial compilation.

  * SLIME support for ASDF was significantly enhanced.
    It is distributed separately from ASDF, with SLIME.
    See latest checkin from 2012-12-26.
    We recommend that in your ~/.swank.lisp you should:

  * ACL: handle SMP vs non-SMP builds in Allegro 9.0
  * MKCL: add support for ManKai Common Lisp
  * ECL: merge improvements from ECL git. Refactor ECL support somewhat.
  * Remove broken-fasl-support: first, cormanlisp is supposed to have fixed it;
    second, cormanlisp is dead;
    third, one can now (setf *load-system-operation* 'load-source-op) instead
    while using asdf:load-system.
  * renaming ends-with to string-suffix-p to avoid conflict with alexandria.
  * Refactor load-system to use *load-system-operation*,
    and change require-system and module-provide-asdf to use that.

  Also note:
  * We recommend you use asdf-utils to access the utilities in asdf.
    Some time next year, we may stop exporting the utilities from asdf itself.
  * To avoid conflicts between alexandria, fare-utils, xcvb-driver,
    asdf-utils, etc., you can use xcvb-utils that solves the conflicts.
    Or you can use fare-utils:define-package-mix that will help you
    automatically resolve them.

cl-asdf (2:2.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features:
    * Most importantly, encodings.
      ASDF now lets you specify an :encoding for a system, module or component,
      that is used when loading or compiling Lisp files. See the documentation.
      By default, the only useful value is :utf-8, and
      we recommend you use UTF-8 everywhere.
      We intend to make UTF-8 the default in the future
      (current default is the legacy behavior of using whichever implicit
      default your underlying implementation is currently configured to use).
      An extension asdf-encodings is available that supports more encodings,
      including autodetection of encoding from either emacs-style declaration
      -*- Mode: Lisp ; coding: utf-8 -*- or content.
    * require-system works like load-system, but won't try to load or update
      systems that have already been loaded, as listed by loaded-systems.
      More generally, you can specify a list of systems as :force-not argument
      to load-system and the specified systems won't be loaded or updated.
    * You can specify :force-not and a list of systems when loading a system,
    * You can now specify :hostname in your asdf-output-translations,
      so you can easily share a home directory via the network
      yet split its fasl cache between several subtly different machines.
  * Bug Fixes:
    * lp#982285. since 2.014.4, the default source-registry
      was skipping anything from /usr or XDG_DATA_DIRS,
      because of a missing test in getenv-absolute-pathnames. Fixed in .15.
    * In 2.019.9 aka 2.20, ECL support was broken by using
      a function in the wrong package (defined in cl-user). Fixed in .1.
    * logical-pathname support was somewhat broken since 2.017.6,
      due to the way most implementations fail to read physical namestrings
      when *default-pathname-defaults* is a logical-pathname.
      Fixed, together with other logical-pathname issues, and
      a test case was added to the test suite to ensure no further regression.
      Works great modulo quirks around implementation bugs on CLISP and Allegro.
    * Make upgrading ASDF more robust on CMUCL, LispWorks, SBCL.
  * Minor tweaks:
    * Use :unspecific in pathname components on more implementations.
    * export and/or document more utilities.
    * add a few missing compatfmt for Genera.

  * UI: Create and use a load-systems abstraction,
   in view of using it in a system-granular parallelizing backend. (.15)
  * Usability: when a system can't be found, there's now a restart to retry
   finding a system after reinitializing the source-registry (.10).
  * Feature: :around-compile now accepts lambda expressions, and also strings,
   so you can specify future wrappers that can't even be read yet. (.11, .12).
  * Filesystem: recursing through logical pathnames in LispWorks (.2, .3),
   on SBCL as on CMUCL, have asdf:subdirectories follow symlinks (.8., .9)
  * Configuration: modify user-configuration-directories and
   system-configuration-directories to return all valid directory names
   even when they don't exist yet so you may create them (.6), also output
   name of non-existing configuration file when opening them for writing (.7),
  * Internals: strcat (.5), split locate-systems from find-systems (.6)
  * Portability: Debugged CormanLisp support (.1).
   Fix type declaration for SCL (.17).
  * Bug fix: don't drop pathname components without a / at the end
   when reading a path using GETENV (.18). (Bug from 2.017.27)
  Closes: #647544.
  * Bug fix: don't redefine reinitialize-instance in ways that break
   its contract and its clients (such as asdf-dependency-grovel).
   Use change-class to reset slots (.16), but not to 'standard-object,
   which breaks ecl, rather to a proto-system class (.19), and not
   using keys with breaks genera (.21). (Bug from 2.017.3)

   have *system-definition-search-functions* not be a defparameter,
   but a defvar with a fixup (.14), clear *systems-being-defined* when

cl-asdf (2:2.018-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bugs:
  * Solved a bug due to ASDF reusing components even when the ASDF definition
    has changed wildly, leading to bad behavior in incremental compilation
    and sometimes total failure of compilation of a new version.
    (Thanks to Xach for reporting and RPGoldman for fixing.)
  * Fix an issue with ASDF doing the wrong thing in case of a clock skew,
    thanks to Andreas Fuchs.
  * Simplification of the internals of perform-with-restarts and
   traverse's do-dep, that should fix some corner cases and make it
   easier to extend or further fix. There scarily doesn't remain
   any unedited code from Dan Barlow's original ASDF, though
   much of the interface design is preserved.
  * Upgrade code slightly simplified, with a particular fix for CLISP;
   it is now tested on all supported implementations, not just SBCL.
  * Improvements to tests and documentation.

  Portability:
  * Many implementation specific improvements for ECL:
   merge with the ECL upstream version, support for the bytecode compiler.
  * Because it is required at least on ABCL, made the Unix vs Windows detection
   a runtime rather than compile-time distinction
   No more asdf-unix or asdf-windows feature, but
   (asdf::os-unix-p) and (asdf::os-windows-p) functions (not exported for now).
   Also recognize darwin as Unix ECL.
  * Also small improvements for SCL.

  Features:
  * Bind *default-pathname-defaults* around load-sysdef,
   to increase chances of successful pathname parsing in defsystem.
  * Fixed run-shell-command on allegro/unix and clisp,
   documented the function, noted how it mightn't do what you think on Windows,
   marked it as obsolete, promoted as an official replacement my new
       xcvb-driver:run-program/process-output-stream
  * New :around-compile hook so you can control the syntax, optimization,
   and warning level, rename packages and balance compile-time side-effects,
   etc., around the compilation of files in your own modules.
  * Now exporting function subpathname, to portably make subpathnames.

cl-asdf (2:2.017-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Promoting 2.016.3 as 2.017. Since 2.016, we have the following improvements:
  * ABCL: jar translation happier with recent compile-file-pathname* change.
  * CCL: see truenamize change below.
  * GCL: vain partially reverted attempts at making GCL 2.6 and 2.7 fail less.
  * LispWorks: use probe-file for probe-file*
  * RMCL: location strings are now POSIX namestrings.
    You can thus share configuration files and environment variables
    between RMCL and other Lisp implementations on same host.
    Use #p"" syntax when you insist on using MacOS 9 style MCL pathnames.
  * truenamize: happier when e.g. the *default-pathname-defaults* is #p"",
    which is the case notably on CCL.
  * Logical pathnames: now preserved by the source-registry's tree directive.
  * Upgrade: instead of unintern'ing symbols, use fmakunbound;
    however, treat compilation of asdf specially, by always making sure
    it is loaded as source before it is compiled,
    so that compilation is never an upgrade and never calls fmakunbound, thus
    ensuring functions in the continuation of compilation are always fbound.
  * Obsolete: dropped support for *system-cache* and get-uid.
  * Internals: refactored resolve-relative-location-component.
  * Documentation: update wrt to the location DSL.

  * Portability: support cormanlisp, xcl;
    fixes for cmucl, ecl; tweaks for abcl, allegro, clisp, genera, lispworks.
  * Feature: un-cerror and actually fix the :force '(sys1 sys2 sys3) feature,
    introduced in 2002 and never working before.
  * Feature: classes asdf:cl-source-file.cl and asdf:cl-source-file.lsp
    for people who use these file type extensions.
  * Semantic change: the source-registry eagerly gathers a list of .asd,
    rather than querying the filesystem over and over again.
  * API change: exposing function asdf:search-for-system-definition as looking
    through asdf:*system-definition-search-functions* for either pathnames *or*
    (new feature) system objects. Should make quicklisp happier.
  * Better support for asdf upgrading itself, with new function
    asdf:upgrade-asdf that knows to invalidate old systems when necessary,
    and is magically invoked before to build any system that :depends-on asdf.
    Make upgrade smoother some cases that were previously broken.
  * More robust handling of version strings.
  * Declaring function asdf:system-definition-pathname obsolete, but still
    supporting it for now, as an alias for asdf:system-source-file.
  * Various refactorings of internals. Splitting a function asdf::perform-plan
    out of the default asdf:operate method.
    asdf::register-system now takes only one argument.
  * Tests to prevent the regressions experienced during this development cycle
  * Tried and reverted: attempts to make asdf more verbose when it's verbose,
    but not verbose by default.

  * Mostly same as 2.010.9: several minor tweaks and bug fixes since 2.010.
  * Will be happier: users of implementations ACL, GCL; users of libraries
    CL-Launch, XCVB; future former users of ASDF-Binary-Locations; people
    with missing dependencies (in lieu of error-in-error); people extending
    ASDF (notably Stelian Ionescu), who'd like to use keywords to name
    component classes.

cl-asdf (1.109-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream. Major changes:
     + main change is the addition of system-relative-pathname function. This takes a
       system name and a partial pathname and combines them to return a new pathname
       _relative_ to the system. This is exported and lightly documented.
     + this patch also updates preference-file-for-system/operation in an effort
       to prevent it from being confused by *default-pathname-defaults* that include
       a specific name and type.
     + Removes inline component methods more carefully (and, I believe, correctly!). Helps keep LispWorks happy.
     + Reworked asdf tests to make them more robust and perhaps more flexible too.
  * Now use texlive to build.

cl-asdf (1.106-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream. Major changes:

      + Minor patch in class-for-type that evaluates only *package* at read
   time rather than (package-name *package*); this keeps case sensitive Lisps
   happy all the time and keeps case insensitive lisps happily insensitive.

      + A patch from Richard Kreuter that allows pathname defaulting to work
   better with *load-truename* and *default-pathname-defaults*; this makes it
   easier to work with defsystems in the REPL.

     Kreuter).
