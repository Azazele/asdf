* Learn to use ql-mapper, to make sure ASDF changes don't break stuff,

** Check that all files have the same around-compile and encoding attributes.
* Have ASDF itself use that.
* Stop the dynamic ASDFn temporary package madness.
 Just Have ASDF-USER that :use's ASDF and ASDF-UTILS
* Have load-op do the selection between loading .lisp, .fasl,
  .system.lisp, .system.fasl, .system-and-dependencies.lisp,
  .system-and-dependencies.fasl, etc.
