* Resolve performance degradation issue reported by stassats and fe[nl]ix
** Is it the warnings feature taking too much resources?
** Is output-files and/or input-files being called too much? Cache it!
* fix upgrade on (abcl, clisp, cmucl)
** Extract minimal test case
* Bug found by fe[nl]ix: infinite loop if the definitions in an asd file
  are not in strict defsystem-depends-on dependency order. Document the issue.
* fe[nl]ix: Defer evaluation of defsystem forms?
* Learn to use cl-grid-test, to make sure ASDF changes don't break stuff,
 and that breakage gets fixed quickly.
* Test stassats's thing:
   (asdf:enable-asdf-binary-locations-compatibility :centralize-lisp-binaries t :default-toplevel-directory *fasl-dir*)
* Make load-op a generic operation that selects the proper strategy
  for each system, module or file, according to component properties and user-configuration:
  compile the lisp file then load the fasl (load-compiled-op),
  load the lisp file without compiling (load-source-op),
  compile all files for the system, link them and load the result (load-fasl-op),
  compile all files for the system *and* its dependencies, link and load (monolithic-load-fasl-op),
  concatenate all files for the system, then load the result (load-concatenated-source-op),
  concatenate all files for the system, then link them and load the result (load-compiled-concatenated-op),
  concatenate all files for the system *and* its dependencies, link and load (monolithic-load-compiled-concatenated-op).
* operation cleanup?
** Kill backward-compat functions after all clients have moved on.
** Kill original-initargs -- BEWARE, it currently has clients!
