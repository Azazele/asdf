* Learn to use cl-grid-test, to make sure ASDF changes don't break stuff,
 and that breakage gets fixed quickly.
* Test stassats's thing:
   (asdf:enable-asdf-binary-locations-compatibility :centralize-lisp-binaries t :default-toplevel-directory *fasl-dir*)
* Split ASDF in parts
** Have it pass test-lisp
** Have it pass test-upgrade
** Get package upgrade right
   Try a newer CLISP than 2.44.1, and if it still breaks, try harder,
   by e.g. having ensure-package return a working defpackage form.
** The unconditional ensure-package-unused breaks test-encodings.script,
   since asdf severs itself from its client package hosting the
   defsystem form during defsystem-depends-on.
** Solution 1: emulate hook on the *upgraded-p* solution, either using
   explicit flag, explicit version numbers or implicit version information
   (e.g. source-code or sxhash thereof, also accounting for dependency
   package information).
** Solution 2: Just "do the right thing" with exported symbols.
* Make load-op a generic operation that selects the proper strategy
  for each system, module or file, according to component properties and user-configuration:
  compile the lisp file then load the fasl (load-compiled-op),
  load the lisp file without compiling (load-source-op),
  compile all files for the system, link them and load the result (load-fasl-op),
  compile all files for the system *and* its dependencies, link and load (monolithic-load-fasl-op),
  concatenate all files for the system, then load the result (load-concatenated-source-op),
  concatenate all files for the system, then link them and load the result (load-compiled-concatenated-op),
  concatenate all files for the system *and* its dependencies, link and load (monolithic-load-compiled-concatenated-op).
* Stop the dynamic ASDFn temporary package madness.
** Just have a single ASDF-USER that :use's ASDF and ASDF-UTILS
* operation cleanup?
** Kill backward-compat functions after all clients have moved on.
** Kill original-initargs -- BEWARE, it currently has clients!
